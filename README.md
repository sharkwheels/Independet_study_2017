# Independet_study_2017
Repo for my independent summer study of making a bunch of arty IoT / internet influenced things.

Week1: Heartbeater. A device you keep with you that beats the heart rate of someone else. Uses a haptic motor, neopixel ring, a BLE Feather, and a Particle.

Week2: Wireshark. Looking at wireshark, pyshark, live capturing of packets, and socket chat

Week3: Playing with a Deauther (no repo)

Week4: IoT Servos (playing with JSON, servos, and a feather)
